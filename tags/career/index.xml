      <description>Not too long ago, one of DrupalACT&amp;lsquo;s developers made a blog post suggesting a developer is not just a developer anymore.
The author maintains the fact proudly that they&amp;rsquo;re probably being a bit grumpy, however there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of merit in this line of thought.
When starting out, it was all about the full-stack developer - the LAMP developer. The fact is, a full stack developer simply has a well-rounded set of skills for a particular type of technology which is usually centric to a given language or technology.</description>

      <description>This article has been paraphrased and changed from it&amp;rsquo;s original creation.
 My previous position gave me a very broad introduction and in some cases mastery of particular skills, and this was lead by a friend and mentor which I moved into his team four years ago.
I am continuing to explore multiple streams of skills, but I have a focus on Go/Rust, DevOps and CI/CD - which aren&amp;rsquo;t even part of my professional skill-set yet.</description>
