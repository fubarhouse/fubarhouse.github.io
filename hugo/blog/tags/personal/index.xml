      <description>Note this blog post is more of a personal journal and guide, there are so many blog posts about this but I wanted one of my own to refer back to.
 Nobody in Australia was ready for Summer of 2019/2020.
The Planeteers comprised of Earth, Fire, Wind, Water and Heart. This can all be correlated to the season we&amp;rsquo;ve had here and of course more broadly is the organic and natural evolution to the seemingly biological Coronavirus identified as COVID-19.</description>

      <description>About five years ago my life was transformed when a certain video game was released. It was around this time I was exploring the idea of how I could move away from using Microsoft products. However the two options I had weren&amp;rsquo;t appropriate enough. Mac simply was hopeless when it came to gaming and Linux wasn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip; mature enough, in that space. It was however on a trajectory so timing wasn&amp;rsquo;t favourable.</description>

      <description>Congratulations to us all, we have finally made it to 2020. The very big year that so many goals were created when I entered the APS in the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency as a mere web administrator working primarily with SharePoint and publishing content.
I want to open with a note about the Australian bushfires - so much damage. We must recognize that we are lucky to have the circumstances we did.</description>

      <description>There are a few things in life which I really love. Consistency, simplicity, reliability and maintainability. Note that configurability and controllability are not in that list. There are not many mass-consumable things which marry these principles, which is unfortunate.
I admit before my current career in development began in 2012 I used Windows every day for everything. It was subsequent position which I needed to use a Mac desktop for work, and shortly moved to using a laptop.</description>
