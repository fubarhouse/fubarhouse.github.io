title: "DrupalSouth in March"

The DrupalSouth committee recently announced the [agenda](https://drupalsouth.org/events/drupalsouth-sydney-2024/schedule) for DrupalSouth 2024 . 

It is my pleasure to announce that I will not only be attending but also presenting.

I'm hoping to educate people on the implications of the Docker Desktop licencing agreement,
as well as some alternatives and architectural differences for those looking for alternatives.

I won't spoil everything, but you can read my [original pitch](https://drupalsouth.org/events/drupalsouth-sydney-2024/schedule/2978) on drupalsouth.org.

I hope to see you there!
