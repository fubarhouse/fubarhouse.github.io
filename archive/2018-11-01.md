> This article has been paraphrased and changed from it's original creation.

My previous position gave me a very broad introduction and in some cases mastery of particular skills, and this was lead by a friend and mentor which I moved into his team four years ago.

I am continuing to explore multiple streams of skills, but I have a focus on Go/Rust, DevOps and CI/CD - which aren't even part of my professional skill-set yet.

I am joining a team of developers! They work closer to where I have guided my interests over the past four years, and I am incredibly excited.

I look forward to working with the team. Please come and say hello if you're involved with their communities, I promise I won't bite.
