I started 2018 believing I could achieve reinventing myself, like so many did. Foolish, I know. But no matter the circumstance, a holiday is a great catalyst for this.

Reinventing myself included short-term goals and contributing progress to long-term goals.

Last year my milestones were impeded by my employer for a variety of reasons outside of my control. Early in the year I needed a move out of my very comfortable situation, so my first successful application was submitted in April, and the application which landed my new job was submitted in August.

Now this issue is no longer a barrier to reinventing myself, I wish to approach 2019 with the original intentions, plus some.

1. Take better care of myself, physically and medically.
2. Drink less coffee - because I have a very unhealthy amount almost daily.
3. Spend more time at home and with family.
4. Learn at least one new language - I've marked Rust and C# for this year.
5. Work towards long-term career goals in a meaningful way.
