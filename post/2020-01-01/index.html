        <p>Congratulations to us all, we have finally made it to 2020. The very big year that so many goals were created when I entered the APS in the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency as a mere web administrator working primarily with SharePoint and publishing content.</p>
<p>I want to open with a note about the Australian bushfires - so much damage. We must recognize that we are lucky to have the circumstances we did. To have jobs, water, a roof on our heads. We must never forget how lucky we are because so many aren&rsquo;t even that fortunate.</p>
<p>Starting this year, I had some very big ambitions for myself. I wanted to take on a number of programming languages to the means of growing skill. Instead of this, I find myself scaling my expertise and time not horizontally, but vertically. This is a good thing, it shows I am maturing or at least being more selective about my decisions. Having been growing skills horizontally since starting my career, I am beginning to deepen my specialities instead of knowing even more.</p>
<p>A curious situation earlier this year was a simply question I couldn&rsquo;t answer&hellip; &ldquo;What do you do?&quot;.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t answer - I could respond with my job title, the technology I work well with or the platform I work with but definitively I cannot answer the question directly. I guess&hellip; this was both flattering and awkward on my part and I seek to fix it. I personally define myself as a software engineer - however I&rsquo;ve got work ahead of me yet to fill those shoes, so how I would market myself isn&rsquo;t completely true yet either.</p>
<p>I am looking out for myself at this point - the last couple of years I go into the year refreshed with a renewed focus and I believe I can continue to do the same. This year I&rsquo;ve been working closer with dedicated DevOps and Infrastructure teams and this will be something I continue to drive. My interests and principles resonate with this crowd. I want to be working with platforms for improvement and not operationally working with a platform.</p>
<p>I could go one of two ways with my career. Given enough time I could continue down the technical path or I could position myself to a management position. I don&rsquo;t want to diverge completely from coding or the technical space but I am wanting to seek opportunity to gradually increase remote work with a goal of full-time remote work in a few years. I&rsquo;m quite confident I could make the jump right now but I&rsquo;d like this to be more gradual.</p>
<p>One area I&rsquo;ve been particularly interested in is Kubernetes and Infrastructure, so there&rsquo;s a few goals are clear to me going into 2020. Having received and declined some informal offers to work with some notably interesting people, I am beginning to pave the way into the future. What am I going to do after being in the public service for 10 years - will formal work be interesting enough to keep me engaged more often than not? I&rsquo;ve been pondering this and other questions and answers that since changing from my previous career have gone ignored and/or unanswered.</p>
<p>Paving the way, I would expect my new years revolutions are more modest and achievable than they&rsquo;ve ever been. I need to find myself a k8s operator to build and develop. Conveniently enough, I&rsquo;ve had an expression of interest from somebody who may be able to assist in formal arrangements. Formal training in infrastructure is probably due and I see this now as an area of interest which previously wasn&rsquo;t as interesting to me. I guess k8s has shown me that perhaps I can have a future in infrastructure if I can play the cards right. As a bi-product in necessity of moving into these directions I aim to gradually increase my remote working time.</p>
<p>I need to get myself into a position of dependence on my desktop system and an office. If I can manage to increase focus on work so that others aren&rsquo;t distracting me while working at home then in a couple of years this will pay off - even more so if I leave the APS. I already to quite a lot of work discretely outside of work so once more this is a logical step forward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been incredibly fortunate to have worked where I am, and have. I started as a web publisher, I have done DevOps and local development. I have done systems and web development and application management and I&rsquo;ve even done my fair share of kubernetes - as a user. Because of the trajectory, I can&rsquo;t see myself stopping or moving back - not yet at least.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also love to call out a passion project I&rsquo;ve been involved with this year. As many people have known since before I started by current position I&rsquo;ve had a secret love for a little project called Pygmy - it&rsquo;s a dead-simple local development environment that comes with zero opinions about your applications. I have become one of the top contributors overall - in fact one of the only ones outside of the project&rsquo;s owner.</p>
<p>I rewrote the project in my favourite language for really a bit of selfish fun. Wanting to get better at writing Go and have fun. It was worked on for months towards the start of the year but I lost inspiration. A conversation I had with a friend one night may have changed that and provided the things we talked about gain momentum the coming years could be amazing. My point is that a friend helped re-spark the project and it eventually hit private testing followed by a public launch. It&rsquo;s everything Pygmy was, except it&rsquo;s infinitely customizable and more awesome.</p>
<p>It works very similarly to docker-compose, and it even uses the Docker daemon directly through its API - so many small achievements I aimed for have been achieved and it has been very well received upstream. I look forward to the future of this project despite it being feature-complete and nothing new will ever come from it. I&rsquo;m happy, and I&rsquo;m quite thrilled that so many people have provided positive feedback and bugs which have since been squashed.</p>
<p>Lastly, this year I ventured to Hobart for DrupalSouth which I&rsquo;m yet to blog about. It was an amazing conference and experience, and I even got to speak about Drutiny. I&rsquo;m not a speaker and there are so many things I could have done better on many accounts but I learnt a lot from that experience. I&rsquo;ve upped my contributions in our wrapper <code>audit-site</code> application since the conference. I want to blog about this so I won&rsquo;t spoil much more - for me speaking was a milestone, and I already have ideas for a couple more. I&rsquo;d like to think I can get myself to the next DrupalSouth in Wellington.</p>
<p>Happy Christmas, stay safe, and here&rsquo;s to a happy new year!</p>
